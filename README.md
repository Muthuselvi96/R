This repository showcases my hands-on experience using R for comprehensive data analysis, predictive modeling, and visualization across diverse real-world projects. Through a combination of statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and effective storytelling with data, I transform raw datasets into actionable insights that drive informed business decisions.

**What You’ll Find Here**
Data Preparation & Cleaning: Efficient handling of large and complex datasets using packages like tidyverse, ensuring data quality and integrity for reliable analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth visualization and pattern discovery with ggplot2 and other visualization tools to uncover key trends and relationships.

Predictive Modeling: Building and tuning models such as k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and XGBoost using packages like caret, randomForest, and e1071.

Model Evaluation: Using performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC, kappa) to validate and improve model effectiveness.

Business Problem Solving: Applying analytics to solve practical challenges in areas like applicant churn prediction, loan acceptance forecasting, hiring outcomes, and sales analytics.

Visualization & Reporting: Creating dashboards and visual summaries to communicate insights clearly to stakeholders, bridging the gap between data complexity and business understanding.

**Why I Use R**
R’s rich ecosystem of packages and user-friendly syntax allows me to rapidly prototype and iterate on analytical models. It supports both statistical rigor and creative visualization, making it ideal for delivering end-to-end data science solutions efficiently.
